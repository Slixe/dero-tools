# DERO Tools

#### Cold Wallet
Allows generating in a simple way and without connection, a `DERO address`, the associated `seed`, and the valid TX Registration.
To validate the account creation on blockchain, you must propagate the `TX Registration hex` using [API](https://docs.dero.io/rtd_pages/dev_rpcapistargate.html#send-raw-transaction).


#### Stress Test
Allows to generate a lot of transactions (registration, normal or SC) in record time, based on the different parameters.

#### Bruteforce
Validates the DERO address generated by a seed (also checks that the seed uses valid words), and bruteforces the seed if it is incomplete or not in the right order.

#### Simulator
Generate a defined number of accounts and save them in CSV format (abandoned)
